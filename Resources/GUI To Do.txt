GUI
- Original Setup Page (no percentage bar) using if statements to refer to the percentage being displayed (probably going to need to be in a loop till final value is 100%)
- Original Place in Which Password is given/told
- Landing Password Checker
- Main Menu(both Worker.class and MainMenuAlreadyRunning.class should have identical layouts, just the slight modification is behind the scenes)
  ID Check screen, followed by the encryption class
- OR (based off of choice)
